An obstacle-dodging Android game built from the Android Studio 2D Game tutorial series
on YouTube by Retro Chicken. 

He didn't make the source code for the tutorial available anywhere, so I thought I would put mine up.
Please note that the code isn't exactly the same as his, I probably experimented with different values
for certain variables, or I may have implemented something slightly differently. The end result should be the
same as in the video series.
